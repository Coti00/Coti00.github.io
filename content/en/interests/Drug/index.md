        <h3>The reason I became interested in AI is described in the AI Interest Card.</h3>

        <h2>Why AI Drug Development?</h2>
        <p>Originally, my dream was to become a drug development researcher. However, I found it difficult to pursue this goal because the field is less competitive compared to being a pharmacist. While studying AI, I discovered the field of AI drug development, which captivated me. I am currently studying hard through the LAIDD site and diving deep into this area!</p>

        <h2>What do I need to study?</h2> 
        <p>I believe that there is a lot to study in this field. You need to have knowledge in three main areas: life sciences, computer science, and probability and statistics.</p> 
        
        <h2>How will I continue studying in the future?</h2> 
        <p>At the undergraduate level, I plan to build a solid foundation in basic AI knowledge and read related research papers. Since this field requires studying a vast amount of information, I am considering pursuing graduate studies. Currently, I am particularly interested in the fields of protein target analysis and cell toxicity prediction using AI.</p>
