        ### Why AI Drug Development?
        
        Originally, my dream was to become a drug development researcher. However, I found it difficult to pursue this goal because the field is less competitive compared to being a pharmacist. While studying AI, I discovered the field of AI drug development, which captivated me. I am currently studying hard through the LAIDD site and diving deep into this area!

        ### What do I need to study? 

        I believe that there is a lot to study in this field. You need to have knowledge in three main areas: life sciences, computer science, and probability and statistics.
        
        ### How will I continue studying in the future?

        At the undergraduate level, I plan to build a solid foundation in basic AI knowledge and read related research papers. Since this field requires studying a vast amount of information, I am considering pursuing graduate studies. Currently, I am particularly interested in the fields of protein target analysis and cell toxicity prediction using AI.
