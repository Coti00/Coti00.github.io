        <h2>Why did you choose to pursue a double major?</h2>
        <p>I happened to encounter coding through a departmental program, and it perfectly suited my personality. I really enjoyed the process of creating something new. That's why I decided to pursue a double major in computer science.</p>

        <h2>How did you become interested in AI?</h2> 
        <p>I first encountered AI through the news. Previously, I only worked on assignments using Python and C++, but after gaining interest in AI, I started studying machine learning and deep learning.</p> 
        
        <h2>What kind of AI technology are you interested in?</h2> 
        <p>I am particularly interested in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) within deep learning. ChatGPT is also a great example of a technology where NLP is applied, and I was very impressed by its ability to learn on its own and make predictions about the future.</p>
