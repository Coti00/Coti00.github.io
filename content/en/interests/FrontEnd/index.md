        <h2>Why Frontend?</h2>
        <p>My primary interest is still AI. I started learning frontend development when I joined a club project to create a website because we didnâ€™t have enough people for the task. I urgently learned React and participated in the project. During this process, I faced many difficulties and setbacks, but I found joy in seeing what I coded appear on the screen. Because of this experience, I plan to continue studying frontend development as a hobby.</p>
