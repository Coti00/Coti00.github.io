**C language** is a general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It is widely used for system software and application development. C is considered a high-level language that supports structured programming while allowing low-level memory manipulation. Due to its efficient memory management and fast execution speed, C remains essential in various fields such as operating systems, embedded systems, and compilers.
