**C++ language** is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s as an extension of the C language. C++ supports both object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming, maintaining the performance and low-level memory control of C while providing high-level abstractions. It is widely used in areas such as operating systems, game development, graphics processing, and large software systems due to its excellent performance and flexibility.
