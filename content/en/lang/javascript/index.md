**JavaScript** is a programming language originally designed to control dynamic content on web pages, but it is now used in various environments such as web, server, and mobile applications. JavaScript started as a client-side scripting language but began to be used on the server-side as well with the introduction of Node.js. It supports asynchronous programming and is a core technology in web development, often used with libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
