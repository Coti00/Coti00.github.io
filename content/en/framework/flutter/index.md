**Flutter** is an open-source UI framework developed by Google that allows developers to build Android, iOS, web, and desktop applications using a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and the Skia rendering engine to create high-performance UIs. With its widget-based architecture, Flutter enables intuitive UI design and rapid development with the Hot Reload feature, making it easier to build and debug apps. It provides consistent design and performance across platforms, helping developers efficiently create diverse applications.
