**React** is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building efficient user interfaces (UIs). It uses a component-based architecture that enables developers to create reusable UI elements and leverages state management and the Virtual DOM for fast and flexible rendering. React is widely used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and web applications, making it one of the most popular front-end libraries.
