**NumPy** is a Python library for numerical computations, providing multi-dimensional array objects and a variety of mathematical functions. It enables easy operations on matrices, statistical analysis, and various calculations between arrays. NumPy is highly efficient in terms of memory usage compared to Python's basic lists, and it supports fast computations, making it widely used in data science and machine learning.
